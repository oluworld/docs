## Qiameth

Qiameth is a funny duckling.

Its purpose is to engineer, in reverse order, a code generator for a compiler for a language that doesn't exist.

Really, the code is meant to be in the vein of the output of SmartEiffel, with a built in debugger and introspection, blah blah capabilities.

And I'm using it to teach myself Pharo, so it's not that old, but the code that I'm trying to build is.
